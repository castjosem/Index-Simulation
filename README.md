### Data structures
The objective is to simulate the operation of database indexes. These are stored in binary search trees whose nodes contain a reference to the first element in a linked list that meets the search parameters specified by the user.

You must implement the necessary classes to solve the problem posed. Implementation should be generic, meaning that the solution may be used for people, banks, colleges, etc.

Later, you must design a user interface that allows to insert records stored in a file. Those records correspond to the data of people. The application will also allow the routes display screen discussed in class tree, delete records, show how many records are stored for each index in the list and find a specific record. These operations should be allowed the user at any time of program execution. It will not be valid that demands to be executed once for each requested operation, there will only be possible execution.
